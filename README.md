# FizzBuzz
The objective is to create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the 
number, for the multiples of five print "Buzz", and For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

I was able to create the application without too much difficulty. After completing the challenge I looked up how others solved this 
challenge on line. A developer that has completed this exercise in Java had setup x = 3 and y = 5 and used them in the conditional 
statement. I thought that was very smart of them because if at a later time we need to change the numbers from 3 to 7 or 5 to 10 we would
only have to change the values of x and y instead of going through and changing all the numbers in our code. This would decrease the 
chances of introducing bugs in our code. 

I added that concept into my code as you will be able to see in the exercise.
